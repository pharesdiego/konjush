  mission: 
  `Learning a language depends on many factors, some of them
  are: love for the language you are learning, inspiration and 
  good resources. Without good resources the adventure of 
  learning can get too difficult and frustating.
  ___
  When you are learning Turkish you know that one of the more
  important subjects to handle are the conjugations. 
  There aren’t many Turkish conjugators out there and usually these create confusion
  and misunderstanding by giving wrong conjugations. 
  Konjüsh was created for solving this problem by giving 100%
  accurate conjugations, working offline and by being free for everyone.
  ___
  The second mission is to reach more and more students,
  you can contribute with this by sharing Konjüsh with your friends, group mates
  or with anyone who wants to learn Turkish. Also, if you click
  <a href='http://zipansion.com/1aV1I' target='blank'> this adfly link </a>
  you will help Konjüsh to get its own .com domain!
  ___
  Konjüsh is an open source project based on the turkish-conjugator 
  repository. You can find this two projects on GitHub:`
